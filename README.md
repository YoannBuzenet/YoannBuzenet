### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Web scrapping with Node during the day, and coding in React/Next/Node during the nights and week-ends.<br/>
Always curious, I love to produce qualitative and maintainable code.

My last projects : 
- A SAAS on top of GPT-3 : www.easyflow.ai
- React-image-manager, a small library to implement in a CMS
- Working on a blog on my spare time, coded from scratch, to share what I've learned coding!

ðŸ’¬ Speaking : English/French/Spanish<br/><br/>
Please reach out !
